This week my effort was mainly focused on developing a web service to demonstrate
usage of the MariaDB package and completing the documentation. You may check it
out [here](https://github.com/swpd/duda_mariadb_demo).

I was also getting myself familiar with the C library APIs of PostgreSQL, the
community comes with comprehensive and clear documentation. For the next couple
days, the documentation website will undoubtedly be my most visited. What's more,
the library comes with native non-blocking support. It rocks, elephant!

This morning I also got an email from Google that announced my successfully pass
of the midterm evaluation. It is an amazing moment and I would like to share with
those that ever helped and guided me.

For the next week, I will get my hands dirty in the Duda PostgreSQL package by
designing the basic data structures and function prototypes.
