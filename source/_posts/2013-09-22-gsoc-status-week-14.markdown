We celebrated for the Mid Autumn Festival last week, it is one of the most
important festival in China. People spent time fooling around with friends to
enjoy the full moon and taste some delicious mooncakes, so did I. I can never
resist the temptation of a cup of tea along with a piece of mooncake, yummy!

At the same time, the hooks section of the internal blog was finished, it is still
not good enough and I will keep polishing it.

For the next week I will still spend my time on the unfinished blog and complete
the final evaluation of GSoC 2013.
