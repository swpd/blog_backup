In the first half of week 11, I spent most of my time completing the documentation
of the PostgreSQL package. You may check it out <a href="https://github.com/swpd/duda_postgresql">here</a>.
Bugs and typos were fixed for that package as well.</p>

<p>After that I travelled back home to take a short break and stay with my dear family.
For this reason week 12 was mostly occupied by family and friends. It is always
comfortable and enjoyable when you can kick back and talk about your recent status
with them!</p>

<p>Before I went home, I intended to make some fixes and continue the blog post with
the working box in my apartment via VPN. Unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t work out and all
I got at home was a pretty old machine which can hardly open more than 4 tabs
when browsing web. That&rsquo;s why this post came late.</p>

<p>For next week I will be improving the codebases, both bug fixing and documentation
polishing, as the final evaluation is coming. And two more sections of the internal
blog will be accomplished.</p>

This week the PostgreSQL package was completed, connection pooling support was
successfully added. Meanwhile, the sibling functions that are used for querying
and escaping string was also introduced into the package to provide more choice
for the user.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate the usage of the PostgreSQL package, I have created
another duda web service <a href="https://github.com/swpd/duda_postgresql_demo">duda_postgresql_demo</a>
on Github, if you ever used the mariadb_demo web service, you&rsquo;ll find it pretty
similar. Check it out for your interest.</p>

<p>From now on till the end of GSoC I will test the two packages I am in charge of
and fix some potential bugs to make them more stable. The documentation of
PostgreSQL package will be completed in no time. Last but not least, I shall
continue the <a href="http://swpd.github.io/blog/2013/05/18/monkey-http-daemon-internals/">blog</a>
about Monkey internals that I haven&rsquo;t finished yet.</p>

This week I am happy to announce the basic PostgreSQL package can pass the build
process and integrate with Monkey. The asynchronous query handling have been added
to the package and serveral bugs got fixed. I wrote some tests to make sure it really
worked out. You may want to have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/swpd/duda_postgresql">package</a>.</p>

<p>Another stuff worth to mention about is I got a bug report for my MariaDB package
(thanks to <code>C1H1O3</code> on the irc), it is a good sign that someone is evaluating and
testing the package because that will make it more stable and robust.</p>

<p>I tried to reproduce the bug and traced the code with <code>gdb</code>, after several tests
I figured out the MariaDB package seemed to work properly. I wondered it might be
a bug from the Duda framework so I set up another tests without using MariaDB
package and could still reproduce the bug. It turned out to be a bug hidden in
Duda and I have reported it on the irc, <code>edsiper</code> will take care of it and I will
see what I can help.</p>

<p>C1H1O3 also advised me to use configuration file for connection pool parameters,
which seems like a good idea as we don&rsquo;t need to rebuild the application if all
we need is just to change the parameters.</p>

<p>Here are some tasks I will be hanlding for the next week:
* add connection pooling support to the PostgreSQL package
* as there are often more than one function to do the same thing in PostgreSQL
client libray <code>libpq</code>, I will add the sibling functions to the APIs of package to
make it more flexible.</p>

This week the draft APIs of PostgreSQL package has come out. You may check it out
on my <a href="https://github.com/swpd/duda_postgresql">Github</a>, feel free to leave me a
comment.</p>

<p>The APIs are modeled after the previous <a href="https://github.com/swpd/duda_mariadb">MariaDB</a>
package. By doing so we can hide the differences between MariaDB and PostgreSQL
from our users and let the packages deal with the details.</p>

<p>The asynchronous APIs of PostgreSQL provide a more flexible way to issue non-blocking
connection and query, for example you can use a string array to specify the connection
options you are interested and leave others as default. Currently I am working on
integraing the APIs with the event handling module of Duda.</p>

<p>Next week I will mainly focus on the asynchronous handling implementation of the
PostgreSQL package.</p>

This week my effort was mainly focused on developing a web service to demonstrate
usage of the MariaDB package and completing the documentation. You may check it
out <a href="https://github.com/swpd/duda_mariadb_demo">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was also getting myself familiar with the C library APIs of PostgreSQL, the
community comes with comprehensive and clear documentation. For the next couple
days, the documentation website will undoubtedly be my most visited. What&rsquo;s more,
the library comes with native non-blocking support. It rocks, elephant!</p>

<p>This morning I also got an email from Google that announced my successfully pass
of the midterm evaluation. It is an amazing moment and I would like to share with
those that ever helped and guided me.</p>

<p>For the next week, I will get my hands dirty in the Duda PostgreSQL package by
designing the basic data structures and function prototypes.</p>
